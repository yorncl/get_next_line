Everybody stutters one way or the other
So check out my message to you
As a matter of fact, I don't let nothing hold you back
If the Scatman can do it, so can you
Everybody's saying that the Scatman stutters
But doesn't ever stutter when he sings
But what you don't know, I'm gonna tell you right now
That the stutter and the scat is the same thing to you
I'm the Scatman â€“ Where's the Scatman?
I'm the Scatman
Why should we be pleasing in the politician heathens
Who would try to change the seasons if they could?
The state of the condition insults my intuitions
And it only makes me crazy and a heart like wood
Everybody stutters one way or the other
So check out my message to you
As a matter of fact, I'm letting nothing hold you back
If the Scatman can do it, brother, so can you
I'm the Scatman
